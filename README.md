# Persistent Khovanov Homology for Knots and Banded Knots

This repository contains all materials related to the development of a 
persistent version of Khovanov homology, with a particular emphasis on 
bifiltrations arising from distance and density parameters and on the 
behavior of Khovanov homology under band surgeries.

## Overview

The project aims to:
- Develop a theoretical framework for **persistent Khovanov homology**.
- Construct and analyze **bifiltrations** for knots and banded knots.
- Investigate how algebraic and categorical structures in Khovanov homology 
  behave under **controlled topological operations**, including band attachments.
- Explore connections to **partial-information knot detection**, motivated by 
  applications where full geometric data is unavailable (e.g., modeling 
  uncertainty or incomplete embeddings).

Although some of the motivation comes from biological systems involving knot-like 
structures (DNA, chromatin, protein folding, etc.), the primary goals of the 
project are **mathematical**.
