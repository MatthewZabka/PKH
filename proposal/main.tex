\section*{Introduction}

Knot theory has emerged as a powerful framework for understanding the geometry and topology of biological macromolecules. 
DNA often becomes knotted or linked during replication, transcription, and packaging, and cells rely on specialized 
enzymes such as topoisomerases to regulate this topological complexity~\cite{Stasiak2009DNAunlinking,Bates2022Topoisomerases}. 
Proteins, too, can display deeply knotted or slipknotted configurations whose folding pathways and functional implications 
remain the subject of active investigation~\cite{Faisca2015KnottedProteins}. 
At larger scales, chromatin and chromosomes exhibit intricate polymeric entanglements that influence their spatial 
organization and epigenetic state~\cite{Smrek2017KnottedChromatin}. 
Even RNA, although generally thought to avoid deep knots, can exhibit nontrivial entanglements and topological 
features in three-dimensional structural models~\cite{Boniecki2021RNAEntanglement}. 
These examples illustrate that knot theory---including both classical knot invariants and newer homological tools---is 
well positioned to contribute to the quantitative characterization of complex, noisy, or partially observed biological structures.

Despite this widespread appearance of knotted and entangled structures in biology, in many experimental settings the 
topology of a macromolecule cannot be determined exactly. Cryo--electron microscopy, for example, often produces 
three--dimensional density maps with unresolved or ambiguous loop regions, leaving substantial uncertainty about the 
underlying geometric configuration~\cite{Henderson2013CryoEM}. Chromatin conformation capture techniques such as Hi--C 
provide only pairwise contact frequencies rather than full spatial embeddings, making it impossible to determine a 
definitive knot or link type from the data~\cite{Dekker2013ChromatinHiC}. Even when explicit polymer models are used to 
reconstruct chromosome geometry, the resulting embeddings may display topological features---including knots, links, 
and slipknots---that fluctuate across model realizations or remain only partially localized~\cite{Benedetti2014ChromosomeTopology,
Millett2005KnotLocalization}. These challenges highlight the need for mathematical tools capable of quantifying 
topological structure in settings where only incomplete, noisy, or ensemble-based information is available. Persistent 
homology provides a natural framework for addressing such uncertainty, allowing knot-like features to be detected, 
tracked, and compared across varying spatial scales or model parameters.

In addition to uncertainty arising from incomplete data, many biological processes modify molecular topology through 
operations that are mathematically equivalent to attaching or removing bands. Enzymes such as topoisomerases and 
site--specific recombinases alter DNA configuration by cutting, twisting, and rejoining strands, producing controlled 
topological changes that closely parallel band surgeries in knot theory~\cite{Wang1996TopoReview,Crisona1999RecombinationCell}. 
Such reconnection events can generate or remove crossings, change knot or link type, or create composite structures 
from simpler precursors, and therefore represent natural biological analogues of band attachments. More broadly, the 
dynamic organization of chromatin and other polymeric biomolecules involves local strand--passage and loop--formation 
events that likewise resemble band moves at a coarse topological level~\cite{Stasiak1988Science}. Despite the ubiquity 
of these band--like transformations in molecular biology, the mathematical theory of \emph{banded knots} has not been 
systematically developed in this context. This gap suggests an opportunity to integrate band surgery with 
topological data analysis, enabling new tools for detecting, classifying, and quantifying biologically relevant 
topological modifications in settings where experimental resolution is limited.

\section*{Research Objectives and Proposed Approach}

The goal of this project is to develop a new mathematical and computational framework for analyzing knot-like
structures in settings where both topological uncertainty and biologically meaningful modifications must be taken into
account. Building on the foundations of topological data analysis~\cite{Carlsson2009TopologyAndData} and the algebraic
theory of multiparameter persistence modules~\cite{CarlssonZomorodian2009}, we propose to construct a bi\-parameter
persistence model in which a geometric ``distance'' parameter identifies the underlying knotted core of a structure,
while an independent ``density'' parameter reveals additional strands, attachments, or band--like features that may
arise from enzymatic activity or incomplete structural reconstruction. This bifiltration will serve as the basis for
a theory of \emph{persistent Khovanov homology}, extending both the classical Khovanov homology of links
\cite{Khovanov2000} and its behavior under controlled knot operations~\cite{Turner2006Khovanov} into a parameterized and
data-driven setting. By drawing on the stability principles that underpin persistent homology~\cite{CohenSteiner2007Stability},
our objective is to establish a framework in which Khovanov-theoretic information can be tracked across spatial scales
and through biologically motivated band surgeries, enabling the detection and classification of knot-like configurations
even when full geometric information is unavailable or when the topology itself may change.
